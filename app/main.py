# NB: if you want to reset the DB *every time the server reloads* (not
# necessarily very helpful!), then uncomment this line:
# models.Base.metadata.drop_all(bind=engine)
# More realistically, you can uncomment that line every time you change
# models.py, just for a quick way to recreate the relations from scratch.

# Basic approach to creating db tables:
models.Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
# (Normally we'd use migrations, e.g. SQLAlchemy's tool "Alembic".)
# "will not attempt to recreate tables already present in the target database"
# https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/metadata.html#sqlalchemy.schema.MetaData.create_all


# At first glance, it the above behaves like this:
# - Create the db in pg before starting the server.
# - Start the server. Relations get added to db as expected.
# - Modify models.py - relations unchanged regardless of restarting server.
# - Stop the server, drop and recreate the db.
# - Restart the server. Updated relations get added to the db as expected.
# So, not a brilliant workflow, but it is kinda temporary and fine for when
# we wanna change schema a lot and don't care about keeping data around.
